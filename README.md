# Product OS

A structured product knowledge base designed for teams that use AI agents alongside human engineers and product managers. Product OS consolidates vision, features, backlog, architecture decisions, and research into a single git repository—with YAML data files for machine consumption, MDX content for human reading, and a generated site for browsing.

The core idea: product knowledge and code should stay in sync. Agents read Product OS for context before implementing, and update it when code ships. Humans review and make decisions. The repository is the contract between product and engineering.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone (after creating the repo on GitHub)
git clone https://github.com/winspect-labs/product-os.git
cd product-os
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

**First-time setup:** Create a new public repo (e.g. `winspect-labs/product-os`), then push:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/winspect-labs/product-os.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Customization (Forking / Building On)

When forking or building on Product OS, customize branding and theme in **`config/site.config.ts`**:

### Branding

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `productName` | Your product/company name (nav, footer, page title) |
| `logo` | Image path (e.g. '/logo.svg' in `public/`) or custom React component |
| `favicon` | Optional favicon path |
| `subscript` | Footer text, e.g. "Powered by Product OS" for attribution |

### Theme

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `theme.colors` | `primaryHue`, `primarySaturation`, `backgroundLight`, `backgroundDark` |
| `theme.customCSS` | Path to extra CSS (e.g. '/theme/override.css' in `public/`) |

**Custom CSS:** Edit `styles/custom.css` for overrides (always loaded). Use CSS variables like `--nextra-primary-hue` to customize.

### Example

```ts
// config/site.config.ts
export const branding = {
  productName: 'Acme Platform',
  logo: '/logo.svg',  // place in public/logo.svg
  subscript: 'Powered by Product OS',
}
export const theme = {
  colors: { primaryHue: 260, primarySaturation: 90 },
}
```
